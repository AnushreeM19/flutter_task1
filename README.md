# flutter_task1
Here is my mobile app created using the flutter platform in dart language. In this app there is basically an audio-video player. For creating the audio player , its respective package is installed. In this case the package installed is 'audioplayers' . Similarly for the video player the packages installed are 'video_player' and flick_video_player' . The methods in these packages are further used to form the dart code required. Thus helping in creating the app.
